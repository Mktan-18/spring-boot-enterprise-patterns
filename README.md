# spring-boot-enterprise-patterns
A hands-on repository demonstrating enterprise Spring Boot backend design — contract-first REST controllers, clean architecture, Spring Security (JWT), Kafka-based eventing, validation, exception handling, and cloud-native readiness.


This repository is a hands-on learning and reference project focused on building production-grade backend systems using java Spring Boot.

## Key Focus Areas 
- Contract-first REST APIs using interface-based controllers
- Clean layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- Centralized validation and exception handling
- Spring Security with JWT-based authentication
- Event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka
- Cloud-ready design (stateless services, scalability, observability)


This project is structured to resemble real-world backend systems used in large organizations.
